# Drag and Drop Upload 

This module facilitates drag-and-drop file uploads in a web page.

There is a server component, a client (browser code) component, and a component
that you have to supply yourself.

## Install

	$ npm install dadu

## Server Component

	$ node dadu.js

The server listens on port 4080 and speaks HTTP.  It performs two jobs:

1. It serves up its own browser code (GET /dadu.js) for use in HTML script tags.
2. It receives uploads (POST /?file=filename) sent by said code.

When the server receives a file, it is renamed to something unique, and stored in
"/tmp" on the server.


## Browser Component

In your web page, first create a Dadu object:

	<script src='dadu.js'></script>
	<script>
		var dadu = new Dadu()
	</script>

And then call the target() function within the object with a DOM element:

	<div id=drop> [ DROP FILES HERE ] </div>
	<script>
		dadu.target(
			document.getElementById('drop'),
			cbStatus,		// called every 1/4 second or with status 
			cbDragEnter,	// called when mouse enters the target element.  
			cbDragExit,		// called when mouse leaves the target element.  
			cbSent			// called when upload is complete 
			);
	</script>

At this point, you can now drag and drop files onto the target element
to upload a file.

When a file is successfully uploade, 
the "cbSent" function receives an object, that looks something like this:

	{
		"error":null,
		"fileName":"foo.jpg",
		"size":11100,
		"type":"image/jpeg",
		"remoteName":"a7ac539356be4e5f8a74e5f8a72e08b_foo.jpg",
		"remoteSize":11100
	}

The uploaded file will be found at "/tmp/a7ac539356be4e5f8a74e5f8a72e08b_foo.jpg"
on the server.
Note that remoteName will differ from the name of the file dropped into the browser.

If "error" is not null, then it will be a description of what went wrong.
Otherwise, the upload succeeded.


## Your Component

When this "sent" message is received, it's now up to you to deal with it somehow,
and to do so within 60 seconds, because the uploaded copy in "/tmp" is deleted after
that much time.


## Demo

To demonstrate, run the server in test mode:

	$ npm install dadu
	$ node dadu.js

Then open "http://yourserver:4080" in a browser.
You will get a test page that you can drop files onto.
They will be uploaded and land in "/tmp", then vanish after 60 seconds.


## Server: Advanced

Note that the server can also be instantiated manually by using dadu.js as a
node.js module:

	var dadu = require( "dadu" );
	var server = dadu.createServer().listen( my_port );

If you use a port other than 4080 here, you must ensure the browser code is doing so
as well.

There are some options you can include as well, shown here with what are used
as defaults if not provided:

	var dadu = require( "dadu" );
	var server = dadu.createServer({
		seq: 0,				// incremented before each upload; participates in SHA1 hashing
		rmSecs: 60,			// seconds after upload that temp files are deleted
		tmpDir: "/tmp",		// file system dir where uploaded files land
		reClean: /[^-._a-z0-9]+/g,		// used to clean up the names of uploaded files
		cleanRep: "_",		// chars matching reClean in filename are replaced with this
		cbUpload: null,		// called when a file is successfully uploaded:
	}).listen( my_port );


The cbUpload callback will receive 2 args:

- error: null if no error, else string describing error
- info: an object somehing like: { file: "somefilename", size: 12345 });


## Browser Advanced

The status() function receives an object that looks something like this:

	{
		"queue":[],		// array of xfer objects waiting to be sent
		"ok":[],		// array of xfer objects sent successfully
		"error":[],		// array of xfer objects that experienced an error
		"current": {	// the xfer object that is currently being uploaded (if any)
			"fileName":"a7ac539356be4e5f8a74e5f8a72e08b_foo.jpg",
			"size":11100,
			"type":"image/jpeg"
						// note that this is same object passed into sent() function, but
						// hasn't had remoteName and remoteSize added as it's not done yet.
		},
		"filesTotal":1,		// num files to send
		"filesDone":0,		// num sent OK
		"filesFaild":0,		// num failed
		"total":11100,		// bytes to send (all files)
		"soFar":0,			// bytes sent so far (all files)
		"percent":0,		// 0 - 100, indicating progress
		"done":false		// true when all files processed and dadu goes idle
	}
