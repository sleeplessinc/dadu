# Drag and Drop Upload 

This module facilitates drag-and-drop file uploads in a web page.

There is a server component, a client (browser code) component, and a component
that you have to supply yourself.

## Install

	$ npm install dadu

## Server

	$ node dadu.js

The server listens on port 4080 and speaks HTTP.  It performs two jobs:

	1. It serves up its own dadu.js file (GET /dadu.js) for use in HTML script tags.
	2. It receives uploads (POST /?file=filename) sent by that browser code

When the server receives a file, it is renamed to something unique, and stored in
"/tmp" on the server.


## Browser

In your web page, first create a Dadu object:

	<script src='dadu.js'></script>
	<script>
		var dadu = new Dadu()
	</script>

And then call the target() function within the object with a DOM element:

	<div id=drop>
		[ Drop a file on me.]
	</div>
	<script>
		dadu.target(
			document.getElementById('drop'),
			cbStatus,		// called every 1/4 second or so 
			cbDragEnter,	// called when mouse enters the target element.  
			cbDragExit,		// called when mouse leaves the target element.  
			cbSent			// called when upload is complete 
			);
	</script>

At this point, you can now drag and drop files onto the target element
to upload a file.

The sent() function receives an "xfer" object, which looks something like this:

	{
		"error":null,
		"fileName":"foo.jpg",
		"size":11100,
		"type":"image/jpeg",
		"remoteName":"a7ac539156be4e5f8a74e5f8a72e08b_foo.jpg",
		"remoteSize":11100
	}

The uploaded file will be in "/tmp" on the server machine and it will have the name
indicated by "remoteName".
The remoteName may differ from the name of the file dropped into the browser.

When this "sent" message is received, your own browser code then must
arrange for the file to be copied from "/tmp" on the server to its final location.
This must happen within 15 seconds, after which uploaded file is deleted from "/tmp".

If "error" is not null, then it will be a description of what went wrong.
Otherwise, the upload succeeded.

The status() function receives an object that looks something like this:

	{
		"queue":[],		// array of xfer objects waiting to be sent
		"ok":[],		// array of xfer objects sent successfully
		"error":[],		// array of xfer objects that experienced an error
		"current": {	// the xfer object that is currently being uploaded (if any)
			"fileName":"a7ac539156be4e5f8a74e5f8a72e08b_foo.jpg",
			"size":11100,
			"type":"image/jpeg"
						// note that this is same object passed into sent() function, but
						// hasn't had remoteName and remoteSize added as it's not done yet.
		},
		"filesTotal":1,		// num files to send
		"filesDone":0,		// num sent OK
		"filesFaild":0,		// num failed
		"total":11100,		// bytes to send (all files)
		"soFar":0,			// bytes sent so far (all files)
		"percent":0,		// 0 - 100, indicating progress
		"done":false		// true when all files processed and dadu goes idle
	}



## Demo

To demonstrate, run the server in test mode:

	$ npm install dadu
	$ node dadu.js

Then open "http://yourserver:4080" in a browser.
You will get a test page that you can drop files onto.
They will be uploaded and land in "/tmp", then vanish after 15 seconds.
